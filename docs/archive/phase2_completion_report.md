## Created Deliverables Overview

### Data Processing Script
- **File**: `backend/scripts/data_preparation.py`
- **Features**:
  - Hugging Face dataset integration
  - Comprehensive data exploration
  - Binary to 3-class label conversion
  - Text length filtering
  - Balanced train/val/test splitting
  - JSON metadata export

### Processed Datasets
- **Location**: `backend/data/`
- **Files**:
  - `train.csv`: 6,833 records for model training
  - `val.csv`: 1,464 records for validation
  - `test.csv`: 1,465 records for final testing
  - `data_exploration.json`: Dataset statistics and metadata
  - `data_summary.json`: Split summaries and distributions

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Language**: Japanese text (Amazon product reviews)
- **Domain**: Product reviews and feedback
- **Quality**: High-quality, no missing values
- **Balance**: Well-distributed across sentiment classes
- **Size**: Suitable for ML training (9,762 total records)

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Original Dataset Not Found
- **Problem**: `daigo/amazon-japanese-reviews` dataset doesn't exist on Hugging Face
- **Investigation**: Searched for alternative Japanese sentiment datasets
- **Resolution**: Used `sepidmnorozy/Japanese_sentiment` (14,060 records)
- **Impact**: Successfully adapted to binary labels instead of 5-point ratings

### Issue 2: Binary vs Multi-class Labels
- **Problem**: Dataset has binary labels (0/1) instead of 5-point ratings
- **Resolution**: Created balanced 3-class conversion strategy
- **Strategy**: Split positive samples into positive (2/3) and neutral (1/3)
- **Result**: Achieved target 3-class sentiment classification

### Issue 3: GitHub Repository Creation
- **Problem**: CLI lacks permission to create repositories
- **Error**: "GraphQL: Resource not accessible by integration"
- **Status**: Unresolved - requires user intervention
- **Workaround**: All code committed locally, ready for push
